    <p>A computer monitor is an output device that displays visual information generated by a computer. It allows users
        <br>
        to interact with the computer's interface and see the results of their actions. Monitors come in various sizes
        <br>
        and technologies, with LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) and LED (Light Emitting Diode) being the most common.

    <p>A keyboard is an input device used to enter characters and commands into a computer or other electronic device.
        <br>

        It functions as a set of buttons or keys that, when pressed, send electrical signals to the device, which then

        <br>
        interprets the signals and displays the corresponding characters or performs the desired action. <br>

    <p>A flash drive, also known as a USB drive, pen drive, or thumb drive, is a portable storage device that uses flash
        <br>
        memory to store and transfer data. It connects to a computer or other device via a USB port and is commonly used
        <br>
        for data storage, backup, and file transfer.

    <p>A printer is a device that produces a physical representation of digital information, typically on paper, but
        <br>
        also on other materials like film or 3D objects. Printers are essential for creating hard copies of documents,
        <br>
        images, and other data, and they come in various types with different technologies and capabilities.

    <p>A speaker is a device that converts electrical signals into audible sound. It's a crucial output device for  <br>
        computers and other audio systems, allowing users to hear audio. Speakers work by using a diaphragm or cone to  <br>
        vibrate and create sound waves from electrical signals. </p> <br>
